# Installation

The current code is not yet publically available, and the old version is very broken and not supported.

# Current State

Currently, work is being done to improve Quilt's toolchain in order to make developing Patchwork fast and easy.


# Keeping track

Patchwork is still very much a work in progress. You may [join us on Discord]({{ site.discord_url }}) to keep an eye
on when development becomes public, as well as find links to Quilt and related communities.
